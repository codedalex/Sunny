# Sunny Payment Gateway - Security Architecture

## Overview

The Sunny Payment Gateway is designed with a security-first approach, implementing multiple layers of protection to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of payment data and systems. This document outlines the comprehensive security architecture that protects the platform against various threats.

## Core Security Principles

### Defense in Depth

The security architecture implements multiple defensive layers so that if one layer fails, others will still protect the system:

1. **Network Security**: Firewalls, WAF, DDoS protection
2. **Application Security**: Input validation, output encoding, CSRF protection
3. **Data Security**: Encryption, tokenization, data minimization
4. **Authentication & Authorization**: Multi-factor authentication, fine-grained permissions
5. **Monitoring & Detection**: Real-time threat monitoring, anomaly detection
6. **Incident Response**: Automated and manual response procedures

### Zero Trust Architecture

The system operates on a "never trust, always verify" principle:

- Every request is fully authenticated and authorized
- Network location is not trusted by default
- Least privilege access is enforced for all operations
- Continuous verification throughout the session
- Micro-segmentation of services and data

### Secure by Design

Security is built into the architecture from the ground up:

- Threat modeling during design phase
- Security requirements defined before implementation
- Regular security reviews of architecture changes
- Privacy by design and by default

## Data Protection

### Sensitive Data Handling

#### Tokenization

- All sensitive payment data (card numbers, bank accounts) is tokenized
- Tokens are non-reversible and specific to each merchant
- Format-preserving tokenization available for legacy system compatibility

#### Encryption

- Data encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM
- Data encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3
- Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for cryptographic operations
- Regular key rotation with strict key management procedures

#### Data Minimization

- Only essential data is collected and stored
- Automatic data purging based on retention policies
- PII data stored separately from transaction data
- Data anonymization for analytics and reporting

### PCI DSS Compliance

- Level 1 PCI DSS certified infrastructure and processes
- Cardholder data environment isolation
- Regular penetration testing and vulnerability scanning
- Quarterly ASV scans and annual audits

## Authentication & Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication

- Required for all administrative access
- Optional for merchant API access
- Supports TOTP, FIDO2/WebAuthn, and push notifications
- Risk-based authentication triggers additional verification

### API Authentication

- JWT-based authentication with short expiration times
- API keys with granular permissions and IP restrictions
- Mutual TLS for high-security integrations
- OAuth 2.0 support for third-party integrations

### Authorization Model

- Role-based access control (RBAC) for administrative functions
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC) for fine-grained permissions
- Just-in-time access provisioning for sensitive operations
- Regular access reviews and automatic revocation

## Network Security

### Infrastructure Protection

- Multi-layered firewall architecture
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) with custom rules
- DDoS protection with automatic mitigation
- Network segmentation with strict access controls
- Private networking for internal services

### API Security

- Rate limiting with intelligent throttling
- IP reputation scoring and blocking
- Request validation at the edge
- API versioning to prevent breaking changes
- Comprehensive request logging

## Threat Detection & Monitoring

### Fraud Detection

- Machine learning models for transaction risk scoring
- Behavioral biometrics for user verification
- Device fingerprinting and reputation
- Velocity checks and pattern analysis
- Network of fraud signals across merchants

### Security Monitoring

- Real-time log analysis and correlation
- Behavioral anomaly detection
- Continuous vulnerability scanning
- Automated threat hunting
- 24/7 security operations center

### Incident Response

- Automated response to common attack patterns
- Predefined playbooks for security incidents
- Regular tabletop exercises and simulations
- Post-incident analysis and improvement

## Secure Development

### Secure SDLC

- Security requirements in planning phase
- Threat modeling for new features
- Security code reviews
- Pre-commit hooks for security checks
- Automated SAST, DAST, and SCA in CI/CD pipeline

### Dependency Management

- Automated vulnerability scanning of dependencies
- Strict version pinning
- Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation
- Regular dependency updates

## Compliance & Certifications

- PCI DSS Level 1
- ISO 27001
- SOC 1 and SOC 2 Type II
- GDPR compliance
- Regional certifications as required

## Regular Security Testing

- Quarterly penetration testing
- Annual red team exercises
- Bug bounty program
- Regular vulnerability scanning
- Chaos engineering for resilience testing

## Secure Operations

### Secrets Management

- Centralized secrets management system
- Just-in-time access to credentials
- Automatic rotation of secrets
- Audit logging of all secret access

### Infrastructure as Code

- Immutable infrastructure
- Security policies as code
- Automated compliance checking
- Least privilege principle in all deployments

### Backup & Recovery

- Encrypted backups with strict access controls
- Regular recovery testing
- Geo-redundant storage
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities

## Conclusion

The Sunny Payment Gateway security architecture provides comprehensive protection for payment data and systems through multiple layers of defense, continuous monitoring, and a security-first approach to development and operations. This architecture is regularly reviewed and updated to address emerging threats and incorporate new security technologies.
