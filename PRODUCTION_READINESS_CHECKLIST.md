## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Prerequisites
```bash
# 1. Ensure Docker is installed
docker --version
docker-compose --version

# 2. Verify environment configuration
node scripts/production-setup.js

# 3. Run security and compliance checks
node scripts/run-security-test.js
./scripts/verify-pci-compliance.sh
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to production
node scripts/deploy-production.js

# Verify deployment
curl https://api.sunnypayments.com/api/health
curl https://api.sunnypayments.com/api/status
```

### Post-Deployment Verification
- ✅ Health endpoints responding
- ✅ Security headers present
- ✅ PCI DSS compliance verified
- ⚠️ Payment processors need production credentials
