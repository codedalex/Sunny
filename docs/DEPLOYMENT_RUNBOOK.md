## Deployment Process

### 1. Pre-Deployment

```bash
# Verify production readiness
./scripts/verify-production-readiness.sh

# Run security tests
./scripts/security-penetration-test.js

# Backup databases
./scripts/backup-databases.sh
```

### 2. Deploy Infrastructure Updates

```bash
# Update infrastructure if needed
terraform plan
terraform apply

# Verify infrastructure
./scripts/verify-infrastructure.sh
```

### 3. Database Migration

```bash
# Run database migrations
./scripts/migrate.js --env production

# Verify migrations
./scripts/verify-migrations.sh
```

### 4. Application Deployment

```bash
# Deploy new version
./scripts/deploy-production.js

# Monitor deployment
./scripts/monitor-deployment.sh
```

### 5. Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# Run health checks
curl https://api.sunnypayments.com/health
curl https://api.sunnypayments.com/status

# Verify monitoring
./scripts/verify-monitoring.sh
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback

If critical issues are detected:

```bash
# Rollback application
./scripts/rollback.sh --version <previous-version>

# Rollback database if needed
./scripts/rollback-db.sh --version <previous-version>

# Verify rollback
./scripts/verify-rollback.sh
```

### Gradual Rollback

For non-critical issues:

1. Disable new traffic to problematic nodes
2. Gradually shift traffic to stable nodes
3. Update problematic nodes
4. Re-enable traffic

## Monitoring During Deployment

1. **Key Metrics to Watch**
   - Response times
   - Error rates
   - CPU/Memory usage
   - Database connections
   - Queue lengths

2. **Alert Thresholds**
   - Response time > 500ms
   - Error rate > 1%
   - CPU usage > 80%
   - Memory usage > 85%

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Database Connection Issues

```bash
# Verify database connectivity
./scripts/check-db-connection.sh

# Reset connection pool if needed
./scripts/reset-db-connections.sh
```

### 2. High Memory Usage

```bash
# Analyze memory usage
./scripts/analyze-memory.sh

# Restart problematic services
./scripts/restart-service.sh <service-name>
```

### 3. SSL Certificate Issues

```bash
# Verify SSL certificates
./scripts/verify-ssl.sh

# Renew if needed
./scripts/renew-ssl.sh
```

## Emergency Procedures

### 1. Security Breach

1. Isolate affected systems
2. Rotate all credentials
3. Enable enhanced logging
4. Contact security team
5. Prepare incident report

### 2. Data Loss

1. Stop write operations
