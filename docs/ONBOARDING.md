## Welcome and Introduction

Welcome aboard! We're excited to have you join the Sunny Payment Gateway team. This guide will help you understand our system, culture, and ways of working. Take your time to go through this document thoroughly - it's designed to give you a complete picture of our technology landscape.

## Our Technology Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Frontend**: React.js with Tailwind CSS for modern, responsive interfaces
- **Backend**: Multi-language architecture
  - Node.js for main application logic
  - Go for high-performance API gateway
  - Rust for core payment processing
- **Databases**: 
  - MongoDB for flexible document storage
  - PostgreSQL for transactional data
- **AI/ML**: DeepSeek models for intelligent processing
- **Infrastructure**: AWS-based cloud deployment

### Development Tools
- Version Control: Git with GitHub
- CI/CD: CircleCI for automated deployments
- Monitoring: Grafana, Prometheus, and New Relic
- Documentation: Markdown-based, version-controlled
- Testing: Jest, Go testing framework, Rust test suite

## Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Security First**: Every feature must prioritize security
2. **Reliability**: Payment systems must be dependable
3. **Scalability**: Design for growth from day one
4. **Maintainability**: Clear code over clever code
5. **Documentation**: If it's not documented, it doesn't exist

### Our Approach
- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular, maintainable services
- **DevSecOps**: Security integrated into development
- **Test-Driven Development**: Tests before implementation
- **Continuous Learning**: Regular knowledge sharing sessions

## System Architecture

### Component Overview
1. **Payment Gateway**: Core payment processing system
2. **API Gateway**: Request routing and load balancing
3. **Authentication Service**: User and API authentication
4. **Transaction Processor**: High-performance transaction handling
5. **AI Analysis Engine**: Fraud detection and smart processing
6. **Monitoring System**: Real-time system health tracking
7. **Security Layer**: Multi-level security implementation

### Data Flow
1. Request Authentication â†’ API Gateway
2. Payment Validation â†’ Core Processor
3. AI Analysis â†’ Fraud Detection
4. Transaction Processing â†’ Payment Networks
5. Response Generation â†’ Client

## AI Integration
