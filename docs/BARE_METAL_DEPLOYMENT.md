## Prerequisites
- Physical servers meeting minimum specifications
- Hardware Security Modules (HSM) - Thales, Utimaco, or SafeNet
- Network infrastructure with redundant connections
- Physical security measures in place
- SSL certificates for secure communication
- Access to vendor support for HSM devices

## Hardware Requirements

### Production Server (Minimum Specifications)
- CPU: 16+ cores (32+ recommended)
- RAM: 64GB+ (128GB recommended)
- Storage: 1TB+ NVMe SSD in RAID 1 or RAID 10
- Network: Dual 10Gbps NICs
- Power: Redundant PSUs

### HSM Requirements
- Dual HSM setup for high availability
- FIPS 140-2 Level 3 or higher compliance
- Network HSM with dedicated NIC
- Secure backup HSM for disaster recovery

## Network Architecture

### Network Segmentation
```plaintext
[Internet] -> [Load Balancer] -> [Application Tier]
                                       |
                                [Database Tier]
                                       |
                                  [HSM Tier]
```

### VLAN Configuration
- VLAN 10: Public-facing services (Load Balancers)
- VLAN 20: Application tier
- VLAN 30: Database tier
- VLAN 40: HSM communication
- VLAN 50: Management network

## HSM Configuration

### Primary HSM Setup
1. Initial Configuration
   ```bash
   hsm-config --mode primary --ha true
   hsm-config --security-world create
   hsm-config --load-balancing round-robin
   ```

2. Key Management
   ```bash
   hsm-keygen --type aes256 --label payment-key
   hsm-keygen --type rsa2048 --label signing-key
   ```

### Secondary HSM Setup
1. HA Configuration
   ```bash
   hsm-config --mode secondary --primary-ip <PRIMARY_IP>
   hsm-config --security-world join
   ```

2. Key Synchronization
   ```bash
   hsm-sync --source primary --verify true
   ```

## Security Measures

### Network Security
- Firewall rules for each network segment
- IDS/IPS deployment
- Network traffic encryption
- Regular security scans
- DDoS protection

### Access Control
- Multi-factor authentication
- Role-based access control
- Secure remote access via VPN
- Regular access audits
- Session management

### Encryption
- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Perfect Forward Secrecy enabled
- Strong cipher suites
- Certificate rotation schedule
- Key rotation policies

## High Availability Setup

### Load Balancer Configuration
```yaml
ha_cluster:
  virtual_ip: 10.0.0.100
  nodes:
    - ip: 10.0.0.101
      role: primary
    - ip: 10.0.0.102
      role: secondary
  health_check:
    interval: 5s
    timeout: 3s
    retries: 3
```

### Database Cluster
```yaml
mongodb_cluster:
  replicas:
    - host: 10.0.0.200
      priority: 100
    - host: 10.0.0.201
      priority: 50
  arbiter: 10.0.0.202
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Metrics Collection
- Hardware metrics (CPU, RAM, Storage)
- Network metrics (throughput, latency)
- HSM metrics (operations, health)
- Application metrics (transactions, errors)
- Security metrics (auth attempts, alerts)

### Alert Thresholds
```yaml
alerts:
  hardware:
    cpu_usage: 80%
    memory_usage: 85%
    disk_usage: 85%
  security:
    failed_auth: 5/minute
    hsm_errors: 3/hour
  performance:
    transaction_latency: 500ms
    error_rate: 1%
```

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Schedule
- Transaction data: Real-time replication
- Configuration: Daily
- Logs: Hourly
- HSM keys: Weekly (secure offline storage)

### Recovery Procedures
1. Hardware Failure
   - Automatic failover to secondary
   - Alert security team
   - Begin hardware replacement process

2. HSM Failure
   - Automatic failover to secondary HSM
   - Verify key synchronization
   - Begin recovery procedures

3. Network Failure
   - Automatic failover to backup links
   - Alert network team
   - Begin root cause analysis

## Compliance and Audit

### PCI DSS Requirements
