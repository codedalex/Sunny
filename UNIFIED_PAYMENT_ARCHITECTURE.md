## Overview

Sunny Payment Gateway has been designed as an all-in-one core payment engine that consolidates multiple global payment methods under a single unified architecture. This document outlines the architectural design and components that enable Sunny to serve as a comprehensive payment platform.

## Core Architecture

### Abstracted Payment Layer

The heart of Sunny's architecture is the abstracted payment layer that normalizes all payment types into a common internal representation. This allows the system to handle diverse payment methods through a unified interface while maintaining the specific requirements of each method.

Key components:
- **Payment Orchestrator**: Central orchestration engine that routes payments to appropriate processors
- **Common Data Models**: Standardized representation of payment data across all methods
- **Unified Error Handling**: Consistent error codes and handling across all payment types

### Modular Backend Connectors

Each payment method is implemented as a modular backend connector, allowing for easy addition of new payment methods without changing the core system.

Implemented connectors:
- **Card Payments**: Credit, debit, and prepaid cards
- **Mobile Money**: M-Pesa, Airtel Money, MTN Mobile Money
- **QR Code Payments**: Static and dynamic QR codes
- **UPI-Style Bank Transfers**: Virtual Payment Addresses with aliases
- **Cryptocurrency**: Support for major cryptocurrencies and stablecoins
- **P2P Transfers**: Person-to-person payments via multiple identifiers
- **Hardware Payments**: POS terminals, card readers, biometric devices
- **Offline Payments**: USSD, SMS, and offline QR codes

### Identity Layer

The Identity Layer serves as the foundation for multi-ID payments, allowing users to send and receive money using various identifiers:

- **Sunny ID**: Core internal identifier for each user
- **Aliases**: Phone numbers, emails, usernames, bank accounts, crypto addresses
- **Username System**: @username format similar to UPI's VPA system
- **Identity Resolution**: Mapping between aliases and Sunny IDs

## Payment Methods

### Mobile Money

The Mobile Money Processor handles payments across multiple mobile money providers:

- **Supported Providers**: M-Pesa, Airtel Money, MTN Mobile Money, Orange Money
- **Features**:
  - STK Push for real-time payment requests
  - Phone number validation and normalization
  - Transaction status checking
  - Provider-specific configurations

### QR Code Payments

The QR Code Manager enables both static and dynamic QR code payments:

- **Static QR**: Permanent QR codes for merchants and users
- **Dynamic QR**: One-time QR codes for specific payment amounts
- **Unified Format**: Common format recognized across payment methods
- **Security**: Signed payloads and verification

### P2P Transfers

The P2P Transfer Manager facilitates person-to-person transfers:

- **Transfer Methods**: Phone number, email, username, QR code
- **Features**:
  - Money requests with expiry times
  - Bill splitting among multiple users
  - Balance checking before transfers
  - Transaction history

### Hardware Integration

The Hardware Integration module connects with physical payment devices:

- **Supported Devices**:
  - POS Terminals: Android-based smart terminals
  - Mobile Card Readers: Bluetooth or USB-based readers
  - Biometric Devices: Face or fingerprint authentication
  - Gesture Recognition: Palm or hand gesture payments

### Offline Support

The Offline Processor enables payments in low or no connectivity environments:

- **USSD Interface**: Menu-based payment system for non-smartphones
- **SMS Payments**: Text message-based payment commands
- **Offline QR**: QR codes that work without internet connectivity
- **Synchronization**: Transaction syncing when connectivity is restored

## Technical Implementation

### Payment Orchestration

The Payment Orchestrator serves as the central coordination point:

- **Smart Routing**: Determines optimal payment path based on cost, speed, and reliability
- **Multi-Method Payments**: Tries multiple payment methods in sequence
- **Split Payments**: Distributes payments among multiple recipients
- **Recurring Payments**: Handles subscription and installment payments

### Error Handling and Recovery

Comprehensive error handling ensures reliability:

- **Standardized Error Codes**: Consistent error codes across all payment methods
- **Automatic Retries**: Configurable retry logic for transient failures
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Alternative payment paths when primary method fails
- **Transaction Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate transactions

### Security Features

Security is implemented at multiple levels:

- **End-to-End Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted in transit and at rest
- **Tokenization**: Sensitive payment details replaced with tokens
- **Fraud Detection**: Multi-layered approach to detect and prevent fraud
- **Secure Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations

## Integration and Extension

### Adding New Payment Methods

The modular architecture makes it easy to add new payment methods:

1. Create a new processor class implementing the standard interface
2. Add method-specific validation and processing logic
3. Register the processor with the Payment Orchestrator
4. Update constants and error codes as needed

### Regional Adaptations

The system is designed for global use with regional adaptations:

- **Localization**: Support for multiple languages and currencies
- **Regional Compliance**: Adaptable to local regulations
- **Payment Preferences**: Optimized for regional payment preferences
- **Cultural Adaptations**: UX tailored to local customs and practices

## Future Roadmap

Planned enhancements to the unified payment architecture:

1. **Advanced Biometrics**: Additional biometric authentication methods
2. **Voice Payments**: Voice command-based payment initiation
3. **IoT Payments**: Integration with Internet of Things devices
4. **AI-Powered Routing**: Machine learning for optimal payment routing
5. **Cross-Border Optimization**: Enhanced international payment capabilities

## Conclusion

Sunny's unified payment architecture provides a comprehensive foundation for handling diverse payment methods through a single, coherent system. By abstracting the complexities of different payment types behind a common interface, Sunny offers a flexible, extensible platform that can adapt to evolving payment technologies and regional requirements.
