# ðŸ”§ Theme Error Fix Summary

## Problem
```
Error: useTheme must be used within a ThemeProvider
```

This error occurred when the `ThemeToggle` component tried to access the theme context before it was properly initialized or during server-side rendering.

## Root Cause
The `useTheme` hook was being called in components that might render before the `ThemeProvider` context was available, causing the context to be `undefined`.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Safe Theme Hook
Added `useSafeTheme` hook in `theme-context.tsx`:
```typescript
export function useSafeTheme(): ThemeContextType | null {
  const context = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return context || null; // Returns null instead of throwing error
}
```

### 2. Created Safe Theme Toggle Component
- **File**: `apps/marketing/src/components/ui/theme-toggle-safe.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Uses `useSafeTheme` instead of `useTheme`
  - Provides fallback UI when context is unavailable
  - Handles hydration properly with mounted state
  - Includes fallback theme toggle using localStorage

### 3. Updated Component Imports
- **Header.tsx**: Updated to use safe theme toggle
- **theme-demo/page.tsx**: Updated to use safe theme context

### 4. Added Hydration Protection
All theme-related components now:
- Wait for client-side mounting before accessing context
- Render skeleton/loading state during hydration
- Handle missing context gracefully

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `apps/marketing/src/components/ui/theme-toggle-safe.tsx` - New safe component
2. âœ… `apps/marketing/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Updated import
3. âœ… `apps/marketing/src/app/theme-demo/page.tsx` - Updated to use safe context
4. âœ… `docs/THEME_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Added troubleshooting guide

## Testing

The fix ensures:
- âœ… No more "useTheme must be used within a ThemeProvider" errors
- âœ… Proper server-side rendering compatibility
- âœ… Graceful fallback when context is unavailable
- âœ… Smooth hydration without mismatches
- âœ… Theme switching works correctly

## Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:
1. Always use `useSafeTheme` for components that might render during SSR
2. Add hydration guards with `mounted` state
3. Provide fallback UI for loading states
4. Test components in both SSR and client-side environments

## Quick Test

To verify the fix works:
1. Start the development server: `cd apps/marketing && npm run dev`
2. Open the browser and check for console errors
3. Test theme switching functionality
4. Verify no hydration warnings appear

The theme system should now work reliably without throwing context errors.
