# Sunny Payment Gateway Technical Documentation

## Overview

Sunny appears to be a modern payment gateway/processing company that leverages advanced AI capabilities through the integration of DeepSeek models for code generation, analysis, and reasoning. The company has built a sophisticated tech stack that combines payment processing with AI-powered development tools.

## Core Technology Stack

### 1. AI Models Integration

#### DeepSeek Coder
- Integrated for code generation and analysis
- Multiple model variants available:
  - DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct-33B (79.3% pass@1 on HumanEval)
  - DeepSeek-Coder-Instruct-6.7B (66.1% pass@1)
  - DeepSeek-Coder-Base-33B (for fine-tuning)
- Trained on 2T tokens (87% code, 13% natural language)
- Supports extensive language coverage (40+ programming languages)
- Features project-level code completion with 16K window size

#### DeepSeek-R1
- Used for advanced reasoning and problem-solving
- Main models:
  - DeepSeek-R1-Zero (671B parameters)
  - DeepSeek-R1 (671B parameters)
- Distilled versions available:
  - R1-Distill-Qwen series (1.5B to 32B)
  - R1-Distill-Llama series (8B to 70B)
