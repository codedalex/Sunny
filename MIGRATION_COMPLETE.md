### 📦 Package.json Files Created

✅ **15 package.json files** created:
- 9 API services
- 6 shared packages

Each with proper dependencies, scripts, and workspace references.

### 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Install root dependencies
   npm install
   
   # Install service dependencies
   cd api/gateway && npm install
   cd api/core-engine && npm install
   # ... repeat for all services
   ```

2. **Update Import Paths**
   - Update relative imports to use workspace packages
   - Replace `../` paths with `@sunny/package-name`

3. **TypeScript Configuration**
   - Set up TypeScript configs for each service
   - Configure path mapping for workspace packages

4. **Development Environment**
   - Set up development scripts
   - Configure hot reloading
   - Set up testing framework

5. **Deployment**
   - Configure Docker containers for each service
   - Set up Kubernetes manifests
   - Configure CI/CD pipelines

### 🎯 Migration Benefits Achieved

✅ **Microservices Architecture**: Each service is independently deployable
✅ **Shared Code Reuse**: Common utilities in shared packages
✅ **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each service has specific responsibilities
✅ **Scalability**: Services can be scaled independently
✅ **Technology Diversity**: Each service can use optimal technology stack
✅ **Team Autonomy**: Teams can work on services independently
